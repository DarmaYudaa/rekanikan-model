# rekanikan-model
The model used for the RekanIkan application consists of 2 parts:

1. Ornamental Fish Classification Model
This model applies CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) method for classifying images of ornamental fish. Currently, the model can only recognize four types of ornamental fish:
- Koi Fish
- Manfish
- Comet Fish
- Glofish
  
The accuracy of this classification model reaches 90%, using the following dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ACWuMCc0erdVTqu5ctNWUsZ4wHO7QqQu?usp=sharing

2. Ornamental Fish Friend Recommendation Model
This model operates by finding similarities among data (clustering) based on the characteristics of fish and their environment. The model is created using the following dataset:
