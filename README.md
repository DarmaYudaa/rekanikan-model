# rekanikan-model
The model used for the RekanIkan application consists of 2 parts:

1. Ornamental Fish Classification Model
This model applies CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) method for classifying images of ornamental fish. Currently, the model can only recognize four types of ornamental fish:
- Koi Fish
- Manfish
- Comet Fish
- Glofish
  
The accuracy of this classification model reaches 90%, using the following dataset: [maintenance]
